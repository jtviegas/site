I am an engineer. I was born in Lisbon, I lived in merry Cork, and I am now based in Copenhagen.


My work is about extracting value from data and processes, whether in an organisation or individually.


I ride a bike that takes me everywhere in the city, and when I am truly lucky I go for a dip in the sea.
